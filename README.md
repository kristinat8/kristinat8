### Hi there, I'm Yuting Tan 👋
🚀 You can also call me Kristina or Tina.

I'm a Ph.D. applicant passionate about building cognitively inspired AI. My research focuses on self-supervised learning for egocentric vision and enhancing Large Language Models with psychological alignment. I aim to advance object-centric video models for embodied AI.

---

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Advancing object-centric video models for embodied AI, with a focus on depth-aware proto-object representation (**EgoViT**) and explicit memory control in role-playing LLMs (**PsyMem**).

* 🌱 **I’m currently exploring:** Hierarchical semantic abstraction and new memory alignment strategies for next-generation AI models.

* 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Projects related to self-supervised learning, egocentric video understanding, and building more coherent, persona-driven language models.

* 💡 **I'm open to discussing:** New ideas at the intersection of computer vision, NLP, and cognitive science.

* 💬 **Ask me about:** Egocentric vision, Vision Transformers, large-scale model training on HPC clusters, or the secret social lives of campus cats!

* 📫 **How to reach me:** Feel free to reach out via **Email** at `tankristina067@gmail.com` or visit my **[Personal Academic Website](https://kristinat8.github.io/Yuting-Tan/)**.

* 😄 **Pronouns:** She/Her

* ⚡ **Fun fact:** I'm on a first-name basis with most of the cats on campus, have had a surprise encounter with a hedgehog, and once met a very friendly Bernese Mountain Dog named "Dà Cōng" (Scallion).
