### Hi there, I'm Yuting Tan 👋
🚀 You can also call me Kristina or Tina.

I am a Ph.D. applicant focused on the intersection of **Robotics & Embodied AI**, **3D Computer Vision**, and **Self-Supervised Learning**. My goal is to develop robust object-centric models from egocentric video. I am also passionate about the applications of Large Language Models in creating psychologically-aligned **Intelligent Agents**.

---

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Advancing object-centric video models for embodied AI, with a focus on depth-aware proto-object representation (**EgoViT**) and explicit memory control in role-playing LLMs (**PsyMem**).

* 🌱 **I’m currently exploring:** Neural rendering techniques for 3D reconstruction and building more biologically-plausible AI models inspired by computational neuroscience.

* 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Projects in Robot Learning, 3D Vision, Representation Learning, and NLP for Intelligent Agents.

* 💡 **I'm open to discussing:** Anything related to embodied AI, visual geometry, foundation models, and human-robot interaction.

* 💬 **Ask me about:** Egocentric vision, Vision Transformers, large-scale model training on HPC clusters, or the secret social lives of campus cats!

* 📫 **How to reach me:** Feel free to reach out via **Email** at `tankristina067@gmail.com` or visit my **[Personal Academic Website](https://kristinat8.github.io/Yuting-Tan/)**.

* 😄 **Pronouns:** She/Her

* ⚡ **Fun fact:** I'm on a first-name basis with most of the cats on campus, have had a surprise encounter with a hedgehog, and once met a very friendly Bernese Mountain Dog named "Dà Cōng" (Scallion).
